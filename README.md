TINAH_custom_libraries
======================

This is an example repo that you can use to create your own custom libraries for the TINAH.


The `phys253.h` and `phys253.cpp` files need to be changed from the ones provided by enph253 [here](http://projectlab.engphys.ubc.ca/enph-253-2016/tinah-2016/).  


You can also clone this repo and use it as a boilerplate.  You will have to change the path to the project if you are compiling using `arduino`.


![> go to `Arduino>Preferences` and change the `sketchbook location` to the directory containing your sketches and libraries](img/sketchbook_location.png)


[Here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Hacking/LibraryTutorial)â€™s a more comprehensive tutorial on writing your own libraries for ardunio - works the same for the TINAH.
